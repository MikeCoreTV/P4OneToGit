P4OneToGit Is a easy conversion tool to make your P4One Repository ready to commit and push with git.

USAGE:
Simply 
* download the P4OneToGit.exe
* Run it
* Enter the directory of the P4One Project you want to convert
* hit the "Convert" button

You will now have a cloned version of the project in the 
parent directory of the original project.
this version will remove all P4 files and will read the
.P4ignore and ignore importing those files into the clone.

The clone will be as such (ProjectName)_Git

To allow it to always be right under your project.

Do not delete the folder, you can keep converting to add new commits.

Enjoy!
